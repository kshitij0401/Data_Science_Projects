**Store Performance Classification Project
Overview**:

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying store performance for a chain of over 100 shops in the UK. The project aims to distinguish between good and poor-performing stores using various machine learning models.

**Project Highlights**:
Classification Models: The project utilizes logistic regression and decision tree models to analyze and predict store performance based on comprehensive datasets. The implemented models have demonstrated accurate classification results.

**Data Mining Techniques**: Python was employed for data mining, leveraging popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The project focuses on implementing and optimizing machine learning models to provide effective decision-making support.

**Collaboration and Alignment**: Close collaboration with the owner and stakeholders ensured a deep understanding of business requirements. The developed models are aligned with the company's goals to provide actionable insights.

**Data Handling and Pre-processing**: Proficiency in handling and pre-processing data from the provided storedata.csv file is demonstrated. This ensures data quality and integrity for robust model training and testing.

**Methodology**: A rigorous methodology, including model training, validation, and testing, has been implemented. This ensures the reliability and generalization of the developed models in real-world scenarios.
